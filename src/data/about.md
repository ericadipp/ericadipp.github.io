# Intro

I am a full-stack software engineer who previously worked in finance for over three years in various different industry segments including capital markets, trading, equity research, treasury, real estate and corporate finance. Throughout that time, I learned invaluable skills on work ethic, time management, strategy and finance that I take with me to all of my future roles in tandem with my technical skillsets in Python and Javascript.

Many of my friends would describe me as a “strategist”. I absolutely love thinking about optimal ways of approaching problems and then planning, organizing, and implementing a strategies to approach tackling them. Many would also describe me as a voracious learner. When people ask me the question what is your passion, for me it truly is learning, growing, and expanding on myself. It’s a large reason why I decided to switch into the field of software engineering, as I am able to do that every single day.


# Why Software Engineering

My passion for technology proliferated after my first introduction to the R programming language in college. In our class, we were using calculus, economics, and coding in tandem to answer sophisticated questions such as, “what is more efficient for benefiting the U.S. economy, lowering gas prices or lowering taxes? We also delved into analyzing the cryptocurrency markets using R and statistically modeling correlative tendencies to other market segments to predict future movements. I was instantly hooked and fascinated by the endless possibilities coding could provide.

My interests expanded as I entered into the job market and began my career working at Jefferies Investment Bank. As I had previously taught myself the VBA coding language in a prior internship, I incorporated that skillset into the job by writing code to automate and systematize many of their repetitive Finance actions on excel. Exploring and expanding on that skillset was one of my favorite things to do.

As I continued my career, I continued to utilize that VBA skillset at companies like CoreVest where, being a company that was only founded in 2014, I was able to make a lot of impact in efficiency. I started noticing that my favorite parts of the job included playing on excel for hours on end where time would seem to fly by for me. That started to offer a good hint that technology might be more of my realm of interest. I decided I needed to pursue more of it.

That year, I took 5 courses hosted on Coursera by the University of Pennsylvania on the topics of Python and Java, which expanded my world. Not only was I extremely interested in what I was learning, but I started noticing and identifying bottlenecks at my company given my newfound technological skillsets and insights. I realized how insightful and powerful it was to be able to be the connection between the Finance and Technology team.

Ultimately, my experiences and continuous curiosity led me down a path to realize a valuable lesson. With the amount I love learning, growing, and expanding myself, I need to be in an industry where I can do that everyday for a job. Once I realized this fact, I decided to leave my job in Finance I had spent years working towards to follow my newfound passion in software engineering. It has been one of the toughest but best decisions I have ever made, and I cannot wait to see where it leads me in this field.
