# Intro

- I am a full-stack software engineer who previously worked in finance for over three years in various different industry segments including capital markets, trading, equity research, treasury, real estate and corporate finance. Throughout that time, I learned invaluable skills on work ethic, time management, strategy and finance insights that I take with me to all of my future roles in tandem with my technical software engineering skillsets.


- Many of my friends would describe me as a “strategist”. I absolutely love thinking about optimal ways of approaching problems and then planning, organizing, and implementing a strategies to approach tackling them. Many would also describe me as a voracious learner. When people ask me the question what is your passion, for me it truly is learning, growing, and expanding on myself. It’s a large reason why I decided to switch into the field of software engineering, as I am able to do that every single day.
